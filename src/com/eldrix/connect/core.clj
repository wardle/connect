  "Create a remote cloud-based server that bidirectionally communicates with an on-premise 'internal' client
  via websockets permitting requests to the cloud server from external clients to be satisfied by tunneling
  the request to software running on-prem, returning the response to the external client.

  The 'connect' internal client connects to the server at '/ws'.
  The external client sends requests and get responses at '/api'.
  Both internal and external clients are authenticated using a JWT.
